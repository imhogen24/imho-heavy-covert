# Next.js Upgrade Plan: 15.0.1 â†’ 15.5.3

## Current Status
- **Current Version**: Next.js 15.0.1
- **Target Version**: Next.js 15.5.3
- **React Version**: 19.0.0 (already latest)

## Upgrade Benefits

### Performance Improvements
- **Turbopack for builds** (beta) - faster build times
- **Stable Node.js middleware** - improved server-side performance
- **Enhanced TypeScript support** - better developer experience

### New Features
- **Improved error handling** and debugging
- **Better client instrumentation** and navigation hooks
- **Enhanced development experience** with better hot reload

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

### âœ… Completed Preparatory Work
1. **Codebase cleanup** - removed console.log statements
2. **TypeScript improvements** - added proper interfaces
3. **Performance optimizations** - implemented React.memo()
4. **Code standardization** - converted arrow functions to function declarations
5. **Accessibility improvements** - added ARIA labels

### ðŸ“‹ Pre-Upgrade Steps
1. **Backup current state** - commit all changes
2. **Test current functionality** - ensure all features work
3. **Review dependencies** - check for compatibility issues
4. **Create feature branch** for upgrade

## Upgrade Process

### Step 1: Automated Upgrade (Recommended)
```bash
# Use Next.js automated upgrade tool
npx @next/codemod@canary upgrade latest

# Or manual upgrade
npm install next@15.5.3
```

### Step 2: Handle Breaking Changes

#### Async Request APIs (if applicable)
Some dynamic APIs now return Promises. Check for usage of:
- `cookies()`
- `headers()`
- `draftMode()`
- `searchParams`
- `params`

**Example migration:**
```typescript
// Before
const cookieStore = cookies();

// After
const cookieStore = await cookies();
```

#### Caching Changes
- fetch requests no longer cached by default
- GET Route Handlers no longer cached by default
- Client navigations no longer cached by default

### Step 3: Update Configuration

#### TypeScript Config
Consider migrating to `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  // Existing configuration
}

export default nextConfig
```

#### Image Configuration (for Next.js 16 prep)
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    localPatterns: [
      {
        pathname: '/assets/**',
        search: ''
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Test Everything
1. **Build test**: `npm run build`
2. **Development test**: `npm run dev`
3. **Production test**: `npm run start`
4. **Lint check**: `npm run lint`

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Dependency Conflicts
**Symptom**: npm ERESOLVE errors during upgrade
**Solution**:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
# or
npm install --force
```

### Issue 2: TypeScript Errors
**Symptom**: New TypeScript errors after upgrade
**Solution**:
- Update `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`
- Check for async API usage
- Use Next.js codemod tools

### Issue 3: Build Failures
**Symptom**: Build fails with new Next.js version
**Solution**:
- Clear `.next` directory
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall
- Check for deprecated features

## Post-Upgrade Verification

### âœ… Verification Checklist
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Service forms submit successfully
- [ ] PDF generation works
- [ ] File uploads function properly
- [ ] Email notifications send
- [ ] Blog pages render correctly
- [ ] Trade-tech pages display properly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained
- [ ] Dark/light mode switching works
- [ ] All interactive elements function

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Check Lighthouse scores
- [ ] Verify build times improved
- [ ] Test hot reload performance
- [ ] Confirm bundle size hasn't increased significantly

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, rollback process:
1. **Revert package.json**: `"next": "15.0.1"`
2. **Reinstall dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Clear cache**: `rm -rf .next`
4. **Test functionality**: `npm run dev`

## Timeline Recommendation

**Suggested Schedule:**
- **Week 1**: Complete current improvements (âœ… DONE)
- **Week 2**: Create upgrade branch and test upgrade
- **Week 3**: Address any issues found during testing
- **Week 4**: Deploy upgrade to production

## Notes

- **Current version (15.0.1) is already very recent** and includes most modern features
- **This upgrade is optional** - the current version is stable and performant
- **Consider upgrading** when Next.js 16 is released for major new features
- **Automated codemod tools** handle most breaking changes automatically

## Conclusion

The upgrade from 15.0.1 to 15.5.3 is relatively minor and primarily brings performance improvements and bug fixes. Given that the codebase has been significantly improved with our recent changes, this upgrade can be done at your convenience when ready to test thoroughly.
